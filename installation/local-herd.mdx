description: Learn how to set up the project locally using Laravel Herd and DBngin.
---

Setting up the project locally is the fastest way to start developing or testing. We recommend using **Laravel Herd** for the web server and **DBngin** for database management.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com/) (macOS & Windows)
- [DBngin](https://dbngin.com/) (macOS & Windows)

### 1. Extract the Project

1. Locate the zip file you received.
2. Extract the contents to your preferred development directory (e.g., `~/Sites` or `C:\Users\Name\Herd`).
3. Since the `vendor` folder is included, you do not need to run `composer install`.

### 2. Set Up the Database

1. Open **DBngin**.
2. Click on **+ Add New Server**.
3. Select **MySQL** (version 8.0 or higher is recommended).
4. Give it a name (e.g., `supersaas`) and set a port (default is `3306`).
5. Click **Create** and then **Start**.
6. Use a database management tool like [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) (which integrates perfectly with DBngin) to create a new database named `supersaas`.

### 3. Configure Laravel Herd

1. Open **Laravel Herd**.
2. If your project folder is within a "Parked" directory, Herd will automatically detect it and create a `.test` domain for you (e.g., `supersaas.test`).
3. If not, you can manually add the site in the Herd settings under the **Sites** tab.
4. Ensure the PHP version is set to **8.2** or higher.

### 4. Run the Installation Wizard

Once your local domain is ready, open it in your browser:

```
http://supersaas.test
```

You will be automatically redirected to the **Installation Wizard** to complete the setup.
