Once you have successfully hosted your files and configured your environment, the final step is to run the web-based **Installation Wizard**.

### What the Wizard Handles

The wizard will guide you through the following steps:

1. **Environment Check**: Ensuring your server meets all PHP and extension requirements.
2. **Folder Permissions**: Verifying that the application can write to necessary directories.
3. **Database Configuration**: Entering your database host, name, username, and password.
4. **Admin Account**: Creating your initial administrator user.
5. **Final Setup**: Running migrations and seeding initial data.

### Starting the Wizard

Simply visit your application's URL in any web browser. If the application is not yet configured, it will automatically redirect you to the `/install` path.

*(Detailed steps for the wizard will be added here in a future update.)*
