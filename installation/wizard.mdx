Once you have successfully hosted your files and configured your environment, the final step is to run the web-based **Installation Wizard**.

### Starting the Wizard

Simply visit your application's URL in any web browser. If the application is not yet configured, it will automatically redirect you to the `/install` path.

### The 4-Step Process

The wizard will guide you through the following four steps to get your application up and running:

#### 1. Site Configuration
Set up your application's identity. You will be asked to provide:
- **Application Name**: The name of your SaaS platform.
- **Application URL**: The full URL where your site is hosted (e.g., `https://supersaas.test`).

#### 2. Database Configuration
Connect to your MySQL database to store application data. You will need:
- **Database Host** (usually `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`)
- **Database Name**
- **Database Username**
- **Database Password**

#### 3. WorkOS Authentication
Set up enterprise-grade authentication with **WorkOS AuthKit**. This step requires your WorkOS credentials:
- **Client ID** (starts with `client_`)
- **API Key** (starts with `sk_`)

<Info>
  For a detailed guide on how to obtain these credentials, please refer to our [WorkOS Authentication Setup](/setup/authentication-setup) guide.

**Important**: Ensure you have added your callback URL (e.g., `https://supersaas.test/authenticate`) to the **Redirects** list in your WorkOS Dashboard before proceeding.

#### 4. Finalize Installation
The final step performs the heavy lifting:
- **Environment Setup**: Saves all your configurations to the `.env` file.
- **Database Migrations**: Creates all necessary tables in your database.
- **Initial Seeding**: Sets up essential data and your initial administrator account.

Once complete, you will be redirected to your new dashboard!
