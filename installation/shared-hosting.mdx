Installing on shared hosting (like Bluehost, SiteGround, or HostGator) typically involves using an FTP client or a web-based File Manager.

### 1. Upload the Files

1. Log in to your hosting control panel (cPanel, DirectAdmin, etc.).
2. Open the **File Manager** or connect via **FTP**.
3. Upload the entire contents of the extracted zip file to your server.
   - If this is your primary site, upload to the `public_html` directory.
   - If this is a subdomain, upload to the specific folder created for it.

### 2. Set the Document Root

Laravel projects serve from the `public` directory. You must ensure your web server points to the `public` folder within your project.

- **cPanel**: Go to **Domains**, find your domain, and update the **Document Root** to include `/public` at the end (e.g., `/public_html/public`).
- **.htaccess**: If you cannot change the document root, you may need to place an `.htaccess` file in the root directory to redirect traffic to `/public`.

### 3. Create a Database

1. In your control panel, find **MySQL Databases**.
2. Create a new database (e.g., `yourname_supersaas`).
3. Create a new database user and assign a strong password.
4. Add the user to the database with **All Privileges**.

### 4. Set PHP Version

Ensure your hosting environment is running **PHP 8.2** or higher. Most hosts allow you to change this in the **Select PHP Version** or **MultiPHP Manager** section.

### 5. Run the Installation Wizard

Navigate to your domain in a web browser:

```
https://yourdomain.com
```

The application will detect it hasn't been installed yet and redirect you to the **Installation Wizard**.
