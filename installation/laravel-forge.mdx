[Laravel Forge](https://forge.laravel.com/) is the best way to manage your own VPS (DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS, etc.) for Laravel applications.

### 1. Create a New Site

1. Log in to your **Laravel Forge** dashboard.
2. Select the server you wish to use.
3. Under the **Sites** section, enter your domain name.
4. Select **Project Type** as "General PHP/Laravel".
5. Set the **Web Directory** to `/public`.
6. Click **Add Site**.

### 2. Deploy the Code

Since you have the zip file with all dependencies:

1. You can upload the files via **SFTP** to the directory created by Forge (usually `/home/forge/yourdomain.com`).
2. Alternatively, if you have pushed the code to a private Git repository, connect the repository in the Forge site settings.
3. Ensure the `vendor` folder is present. If you are using Git, make sure you haven't ignored the `vendor` folder if you intend to skip `composer install` on the server.

### 3. Set Up the Database

1. In the Forge dashboard, go to the **Servers** tab and select your server.
2. Click on **Databases**.
3. Create a new database and a database user. Forge will handle the permissions automatically.

### 4. Configure the Environment

1. In the **Site** settings on Forge, click on **Environment**.
2. You don't need to manually edit the `.env` file yet, as the Installation Wizard will handle this.
3. Ensure the PHP version is set to **8.2** or higher.

### 5. Run the Installation Wizard

Visit your domain in the browser:

```
https://yourdomain.com
```

You will be greeted by the **Installation Wizard** to finalize the configuration.
