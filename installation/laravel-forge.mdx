description: Learn how to deploy the project to a VPS using Laravel Forge.

[Laravel Forge](https://forge.laravel.com/) is the best way to manage your own VPS (DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS, etc.) for Laravel applications.

### 1. Create a New Site

1. Log in to your **Laravel Forge** dashboard.
2. Select the server you wish to use.
3. Under the **Sites** section, enter your domain name.
4. Select **Project Type** as "General PHP/Laravel".
5. Set the **Web Directory** to `/public`.
6. Click **Add Site**.

### 2. Deploy the Code

There are two primary ways to deploy your code to Laravel Forge: using a Git repository (recommended) or uploading via SFTP.

#### Option A: Using Git (GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab)

This is the recommended method as it allows for easy updates and version control.

1. **Initialize your Local Repository**:
   Extract the zip file locally, open your terminal in that folder, and run:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```
2. **Push to your Git Provider**:
   Create a new **private** repository on GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab, and push your code there.
3. **Connect to Forge**:
   - In your Forge Site settings, go to the **Git Repository** section.
   - Select your provider and enter your repository name (e.g., `your-user/your-repo`).
   - Ensure "Install Composer Dependencies" is **unchecked** if you are pushing the `vendor` folder, or checked if you want Forge to run `composer install`.
   - Click **Install Repository**.

#### Option B: Upload via SFTP

1. Connect to your server using an SFTP client (like FileZilla or Transmit) using the credentials provided by Forge when the server was created.
2. Navigate to the site directory (usually `/home/forge/yourdomain.com`).
3. Upload the entire contents of the extracted zip file.
4. Ensure the `vendor` folder is included in the upload.

### 3. Set Up the Database

1. In the Forge dashboard, go to the **Servers** tab and select your server.
2. Click on **Databases**.
3. Create a new database and a database user. Forge will handle the permissions automatically.

### 4. Configure the Environment

1. In the **Site** settings on Forge, click on **Environment**.
2. You don't need to manually edit the `.env` file yet, as the Installation Wizard will handle this.
3. Ensure the PHP version is set to **8.2** or higher.

### 5. Run the Installation Wizard

Visit your domain in the browser:

```
https://yourdomain.com
```

You will be greeted by the **Installation Wizard** to finalize the configuration.
