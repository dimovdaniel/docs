SuperSaaS is a Laravel-based SaaS application you can self-host. These docs cover:

- **Installation**: running the project locally, on shared hosting, or on a VPS.
- **Admin setup**: configuring authentication, AI, subscriptions, queues, plugins, translations, landing page, and email delivery.
- **Operations**: keeping background jobs and scheduled tasks running in production.
