description: Keep your installation up to date.

You can update your installation by downloading the latest release package from us and replacing your current codebase.

### How updates work

Because the project is distributed as a zip file (including `vendor/`), updating is usually a simple **code replacement**:

1. Download the latest release zip.
2. Extract it locally.
3. Upload / replace your application files on the server (or in your local environment).
4. Keep your environment configuration (`.env`) and any user-generated files intact.

<Info>
  This is the initial release. The update process will evolve as we introduce incremental updates and more automation.
