Our application is designed with a modular architecture, allowing you to extend its functionality through various plugins. Each plugin can have its own unique configuration options.

### Accessing Plugin Settings

To manage your plugins and their settings, you must be logged in as an **administrator**.

1.  Navigate to **Settings** in the main sidebar.
2.  Go to **Admin** > **Plugins**.

### Configuring Individual Plugins

When you are in the Plugins section, you will see a list of installed and active plugins. 

- **Plugin-Specific Menus**: Each active plugin will provide its own configuration menu, typically visible on the right side or within the plugin's detail view.
- **Custom Settings**: Depending on the plugin, you may need to enter API keys, toggle specific features, or configure display options unique to that plugin.

### Example Plugin Configurations

- **Content Generator**: May require settings for tone of voice, default languages, or specific AI model overrides.
- **Social Media Poster**: Will require OAuth connections or API tokens for platforms like X (Twitter), LinkedIn, or Facebook.

  **Note**: Always remember to click **Save** within each plugin's settings menu to apply your changes.
