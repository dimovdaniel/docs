title: Translations
description: Manage UI translations and locale strings.
---

As an administrator, you can manage your application's translations (languages, keys, and phrases) from the built-in translations UI.

### Where to manage translations

1. Log in as an **admin**.
2. Go to **Settings → Admin → Translations** (or open the translations UI directly at `/translations`).

### Translation management UI

We use the **Laravel Translations UI** package for translation management. It provides a full UI for creating, editing, importing, exporting, and searching translations.

- Package docs: [MohmmedAshraf/laravel-translations](https://github.com/MohmmedAshraf/laravel-translations)

### Common workflows

- **Add a new language**: Create the locale and start adding translations in the UI.
- **Edit existing translations**: Search by key/value, then update phrases and publish/export when ready.
- **Import/Export**: Use the package's import/export commands or UI features (depending on your setup) as described in the package documentation.
