Our application uses **OpenRouter** to provide a unified interface for various Large Language Models (LLMs). This allows you to choose from a wide range of models like Claude, GPT-4, and many others.

### Configuring AI Settings

To configure your AI settings, you must be logged in as an **administrator**.

1.  Navigate to **Settings** in the main sidebar.
2.  Go to **Admin** > **AI**.

### Getting Started with OpenRouter

Before configuring the settings in the application, you need an OpenRouter account:

1.  **Sign up**: Create an account at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/).
2.  **Get your API Key**: Navigate to [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys) and generate a new API key.
3.  **Explore Models**: You can find a list of available model identifiers (e.g., `anthropic/claude-3-opus`, `openai/gpt-4-turbo`) at [openrouter.ai/models](https://openrouter.ai/models).

### AI Settings Configuration

In the **Admin > AI** section of your application, enter the following details:

-   **OpenRouter API Key**: Enter the API key you generated (it will be masked for security).
-   **OpenRouter Model**: Enter the model identifier you wish to use. 
    -   *Default/Example*: `openai/gpt-oss-20b:free`

Click **Save** to apply the changes.

<Info>
  **Pro Tip**: Using a "free" model identifier like `openai/gpt-oss-20b:free` is a great way to test your integration without incurring costs.
