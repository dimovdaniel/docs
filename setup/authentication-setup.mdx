Our application uses **WorkOS AuthKit** to provide secure, enterprise-grade authentication. This guide will walk you through obtaining the necessary credentials and configuring your WorkOS dashboard.

### How to get your WorkOS credentials

Follow these steps to set up your WorkOS project and retrieve your API keys:

1.  **Go to the WorkOS Dashboard**: Log in to your [WorkOS Dashboard](https://dashboard.workos.com/).
2.  **Navigate to API Keys**: Click on **API Keys** in the left sidebar.
3.  **Copy your Client ID**: Locate your **Client ID** (it starts with `client_`) and copy it.
4.  **Create or copy a Secret Key**: Generate a new **Secret Key** (it starts with `sk_`) or copy an existing one.
5.  **Configure Redirects**:
    - In the WorkOS Dashboard, navigate to the **Redirects** section.
    - Add your application's callback URL to the **Redirects** list.

### Create an Admin User

After your application is installed, you will need to register an account and manually assign yourself the **admin** role in the WorkOS Dashboard to access the administrative features of your SaaS.

1.  **Register an Account**: Visit your application's registration page and create a new account.
2.  **Locate the User in WorkOS**:
    - Go to the **Users** section in the [WorkOS Dashboard](https://dashboard.workos.com/).
    - Find the user you just created and click on their name.
3.  **Assign the Admin Role**:
    - Go to the **Organization memberships** tab.
    - Click **Edit roles**.
    - Add the `admin` role to the user.
    - Save your changes.

<Warning>
  **Important**: You must add `https://yourdomain.com/authenticate` (or `https://supersaas.test/authenticate` for local development) to your **Redirects** list in the WorkOS Dashboard before proceeding with the installation.
</Warning>

### Environment Variables

The Installation Wizard will automatically save these credentials to your `.env` file, but for reference, they are:

```env
WORKOS_CLIENT_ID=client_...
WORKOS_API_KEY=sk_...
WORKOS_REDIRECT_URI=https://yourdomain.com/authenticate
```

### Next Steps

Once you have your credentials, return to the **Installation Wizard** to complete the setup.
