title: Queues
description: Configure background job processing.
---

This project performs certain tasks asynchronously (for example: background processing, content generation, integrations, etc.). Running a queue worker ensures those tasks are processed reliably and quickly.

### Recommended approach (VPS): Real Laravel Queues

If you are deploying on a VPS (for example via **Laravel Forge**), you should run **real Laravel queue workers**. This is the recommended setup for production because it is reliable, scalable, and designed for long-running background work.

#### 1. Set your queue connection

In your `.env`, configure a real queue driver (common choices are `database` or `redis`):

```env
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
```

If you use `database`, make sure your migrations have been run so the queue tables exist.

#### 2. Running queue workers on Laravel Forge

On Forge, you typically run queue workers via **Supervisor** (Forge can manage this for you).

- **Create a queue worker** in Forge for your site (Supervisor / Queue Workers)
- **Set the command** to run your worker, for example:

```bash
php /home/forge/yourdomain.com/artisan queue:work --sleep=3 --tries=3 --timeout=120
```

Notes:
- **Path**: Replace `/home/forge/yourdomain.com` with your actual site path on the server.
- **Multiple workers**: If you have higher traffic / more background jobs, run multiple workers.
- **Deployments**: After a deploy, you may need to restart workers so they pick up new code (Forge can do this automatically depending on your setup).

#### 3. Don’t forget the scheduler (recommended)

Even with queue workers, many Laravel apps also rely on the scheduler. Add the standard cron entry (once per minute):

```bash
* * * * * php /home/forge/yourdomain.com/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

### Shared hosting fallback: Cron calling `/job/{count}`

If you are on **shared hosting** and cannot run long-running `php artisan queue:work` processes, you can use the built-in fallback route that processes a number of jobs per request:

```php
Route::get('job/{count?}', [JobController::class, 'process'])->name('jobs.process');
```

This route is defined in:
- `supersaas/routes/web.php`

#### 1. Create a cron job on your shared host

Create a cron job that hits your application URL on a schedule (for example every minute):

```bash
* * * * * wget -q -O /dev/null "https://yourdomain.com/job/10"
```

Or using `curl`:

```bash
* * * * * curl -fsS "https://yourdomain.com/job/10" > /dev/null
```

Where:
- `10` is the **count** (how many jobs to process per request). Tune this value based on your hosting limits.

<Warning>
  **Important**: This HTTP cron approach is a fallback for shared hosting only. For best reliability and performance, use real Laravel queues on a VPS.
</Warning>

#### 2. Security note

Because this is a public URL endpoint, ensure you are comfortable exposing it. If you are deploying to a public domain, consider restricting access (for example by adding an additional layer of protection in your hosting panel) so random traffic cannot trigger it.
