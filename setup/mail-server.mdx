To ensure your application can send notifications, password resets, and other automated emails, you must configure the mail server settings.

### Accessing Mail Settings

To configure your mail server, you must be logged in as an **administrator**.

1.  Navigate to **Settings** in the main sidebar.
2.  Go to **Admin** > **Mail**.

### SMTP Configuration

Our application uses standard SMTP for email delivery. You will need the following details from your email provider (e.g., Mailgun, SendGrid, Amazon SES, or a traditional SMTP server):

- **Mail Host**: The address of your SMTP server (e.g., `smtp.mailgun.org`).
- **Mail Port**: The port used by your server (usually `587` for TLS or `465` for SSL).
- **Mail Username**: Your SMTP username.
- **Mail Password**: Your SMTP password.
- **Mail Encryption**: Choose between `tls`, `ssl`, or `none`.
- **From Address**: The email address that will appear as the sender (e.g., `hello@yourdomain.com`).
- **From Name**: The name that will appear as the sender (e.g., `SuperSaaS Support`).

### Testing Your Configuration

Once you have entered your credentials:

1. Click **Save Settings**.
2. Use the **Send Test Email** feature (if available) to verify that the connection is working correctly.

  **Note**: If you are using a service like Gmail, you may need to generate an "App Password" rather than using your primary account password.
